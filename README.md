# PA-County-Census-Analysis
- Within this project, I take in data from Google's BigQuery Public Data and extract a table called 'census_bureau_acs.county_2018_5yr'.
- From there a answer a series of questions regarding population, poverty, and age within the Counties of Pennsylvania through the use of data analysis and visualization.
